SemiAmusingBot
==============

This is a fork of RedditBot
A simple Reddit bot in Python.

A software bot is a program that can interact with websites autonomously. They can be as simple or as complex as you want them to be.

The bot runs in the background and monitors a website. When it sees a change (like a post on Reddit), it can reply to it, upvote, or do any other task it was programmed to.


To learn how to build this bot, please see:

http://pythonforengineers.com/build-a-reddit-bot-part-1/

install.sh in Part 3 is for Unix installs.  For Windows installs, you will need to:
1. Install Python 2.7 
2. Install Pip for Windows
3. Install praw with pip
4. Download these scripts to run.

I will check in the code when I've made the initial changes - for now, the code is the same as RedditBot here on Github
